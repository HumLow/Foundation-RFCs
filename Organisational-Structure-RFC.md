## §1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

##### §1.1 Abstract

As the HumLow Foundation is to be governed by its Members, the delegation of power whether it be
executive or otherwise should always stem from the Members. The objective of this document is to present

the basis for how the Foundation is to operate, specifically how power is assigned and regulated through an
Annual Congress with Delegates from the community. The document shall be published as an RFC and is then

to be used for the founding of the Bylaws.

## §2 GOOD FAITH

##### §2.1 All individuals associated with the HumLow Foundation must act in Good Faith

The Foundation is run by humans. It is human to make mistakes; thus it is always forgivable to make mistakes.
What is not acceptable, however, is malice. All members, especially those in positions of power, are expected

to always act in Good Faith. If a decision that can in Good Faith reasonably be deemed to have been made in
Bad Faith that decision shall become void.


##### §2.2 An example of a Bad Faith decision that should become void

Ben is a Board Member. He calls submits a motion to the Board that the Foundation shall sign a contract with
a record label. The Board votes in favour and signs the contract. What Ben knowingly did not tell the Board is
that the record label is owned by Ben’s sister and that she has promised him a thousand dollars for the
contract. Ben is acting in Bad Faith and when he is found out the motion becomes invalidated and retracted.
The contract will to the fullest extent possible of the law be withdrawn. The Board is required to notify the
Board Auditors and any Ethics Board if one exists. The Auditors and/or the Ethics Board shall review the
incident and may call for an impeachment hearing against Ben. During the investigation, Ben may even be
temporarily relieved from duty.

##### §2.3 Good Faith as it pertains to the interpretation of Bylaws, RFCs, and other regulatory

##### documents

All documents are presumed to be written in Good Faith, thus mistakes are allowed. Of course, these
mistakes should be remediated swiftly upon discovery, but now and then some may be tempted to use these
mistakes or any other “loopholes” either for personal gain or for malice. When interpreting these documents
one should focus on the intention of the author(s). Whenever there is uncertainty it’s important to presume and
act in Good Faith and it is never a bad idea to consult with the community to find a consensus.

## §3 BYLAWS AND POLICY

##### §3.1 The Bylaws

The Bylaws of the Foundation are set by the Annual Congress and define the rules of how the Foundation is
allowed to operate. The Bylaws can only be amended by an Ordinary Annual Congress (meaning an Annual
Congress that is not an Extra Congress) and must be ratified by the Ordinary Annual Congress the following
year. The Meeting Summons must clearly provide notification that a vote regarding Bylaws is to take place. The
first section of the Bylaws state the Foundations Mission and require the vote to reach at least a ⅘ths majority
in both Congresses's to be amended and may not fundamentally change the Mission of the Foundation.

##### §3.2 Policies and Guidelines

The Foundation’s Policies are standards all users should normally follow, and guidelines are generally meant to
be best practices for following those standards in specific contexts. Policies and guidelines should always be
applied using reason and common sense. Policies can be created by the Foundation or by its Members.

Policies are unlike the rigid Bylaws intended to be fluid and able to adapt as the Foundation and our society
changes. Policies should be reasonable, clear and easy to understand, and should reflect the opinions and
values of the Foundation and its Members.

The lifecycle of a Member-originating Policy can work as follows. A member or a group of members creates a
policy document. They submit a motion to the Annual Congress for the document to become Policy. If the
policy is approved by the Annual Congress it shall become Official Policy. Members can of course also submit
motions to retire old Policies as well.


## §4 MEMBERSHIP RFC

##### §4.1 Membership as it pertains during the writing of this RFC

A Member is here defined as a private individual who is registered as a Member and who have properly paid
the membership fees. The terms of Membership is defined in the Bylaws. The membership fees are subject to

Congress rulings but are originally suggested to be $20 United States Dollars paid to the HumLow
Foundation’s Open Collective.

The actual procedure and details regarding Membership shall be in its own RFC, after which this document

may need amending.

## §5 THE ANNUAL CONGRESS

##### §5.1 Abstract

The Annual Congress, or simply the Congress, is the highest governing body in the organisation. All
subsequent bodies and officials are subject to the authority of the Congress.

##### §5.2 Occurrence and Summons

The Annual Congress meeting should be held in the first quarter of the fiscal year. Special Congress meetings
can be called in the event of an emergency, or when a majority of Members call for it. The Special Congresses

in most cases, except those regarding Bylaws hold the same authority as the Ordinary Congress.

An invitation called a Meeting Summons is to be made available to all Members. It include the dates and
locations as well as the Agenda and instructions for how to submit motions and candidacies. For practical
reasons the voting body of the Congress consist of Delegates, see §5.4. The procedure for how to apply to
become a Delegate shall also be included.

##### §5.3 Presidium

The Congress is to be presided by a Chairperson who holds the meeting. A secretary who takes minutes in
the proceedings protocol. At least two adjusters who review the proceedings protocol, and who act as vote
counters if necessary. The initial Presidium at the start of the Congress is the departing Board Presidium. Once
the Congress Meeting is opened a new Meeting Presidium is chosen by the Delegates (see §5.4). The new
Presidium may be the same, but should preferably be from a third party, or a mix thereof. The Presidium is to
act as a neutral party and do not have the right to vote. However, the Chairperson may act as a tie-breaker if
no other option is available.

During the Congress, the Presidium presents the Agenda, manages speakers, holds votes, ensure the Bylaws
are abided by, and decide Meeting Procedure as necessary and as decided by the Congress.

##### §5.4 Delegates

The Congress Delegates are the voting body of the Congress. The Delegates are to consist of no more than
one hundred Members. If more than one hundred Members apply to be a Delegate the community should be
consulted through Rapid Democracy (See RFC RFC-2021-12-21-RD) for how to handle the situation. For
example, a vote can be held. Care should be taken that new Members still have the opportunity to participate.


Note that the Congress is open to all Members, here called Observing Members or simply Observers.
Observers do not have voting rights but may have some rights, for example, to ask questions regarding
Meeting Procedures. This is adjusted in the Congress Meeting Procedures that the Congress votes to approve
in each Congress.

The Delegate Members should be a fair and accurate representation of the Organisations Members of whom
they collectively represent. Each Delegate holds one equal vote.

##### §5.5 Tasks

The Annual Congress has three primary tasks
I. To review the activities of the past fiscal year

II. Vote on motions regarding policy, budget, and operations for the new Operative Year
III. Elect Officials for the Board and committees

## §6 THE FOUNDATION BOARD

##### §6.1 Abstract

The Foundation Board, or simply the Board, is the highest governing body between Congresses. The Board is

subject to the authority of the Annual Congress and Bylaws. The Board is to hold regular meetings at their
discretion, suggestively quarterly or monthly. The Board is responsible for organising the Annual Congress

according to the Bylaws. The Board is departs in junction with the Annual Congress at the end of Term and a
new one is sworn in at the Constitutional Meeting that is to be held immediately after the Annual Congress.

##### §6.2 The Boards relation to the LLC

The HumLow Foundation is to conduct its business and day to day operations through its daughter company
The Humble Lowly Company LLC (“the LLC”). The Foundation Board in practice serves as the LLC Board of
Directors. The Foundation Board shall oversee LLC operations but is recommended to leave actual day-to-day
operations to the LLC Executives. The Foundation Board has the authority to within the bounds of the Bylaws
and the Law remove and appoint Executives of the LLC, including the position for Chief Executive Officer.

##### §6.3 Officials

The Board is to have the following Elected Officials, sorted by group and ranked by hierarchy

**- The Presidium:** Collective designation for the highest ranked officials of the Board. All Presidium Members
    serve as Members of the Board
    - **Chairperson/President:** The highest ranked official in the Foundation. The Chairperson convenes and
       presides over the Board Meetings. In the case of a voting tie, the Chairperson may break the tie.
    **- Treasurer:** Holds the same hierarchal rank as the Secretary. The Treasurer is responsible for the
       Foundation’s finances. The Treasurer oversees spending and presents the budget. The Treasurer is also
       an administrator of the OpenCollective and is responsible for approving and rejecting expense reports.
       For large transactions, the signature of both the Treasurer and a second person from the Presidium
       should be required.


**- Secretary:** Holds the same hierarchal rank as the Treasurer. The Secretary is responsible for the
    Foundation’s bookkeeping and documents. The Secretary is to record the minutes of all Board meetings,
    and may also be responsible for drafting Board briefings and/or other tasks the Board requires.
**- Board Members:** Each Board Member holds an equal vote in Board meetings. The Congress decides on
how many Board Members to elect for the following operational year. It should however be between three
and seven, including the Presidium. It may not be fewer than three and may not be more than twenty-one. It
is recommended that there be an odd number of Board Members to avoid ties.
**- Special Members
- Supplementary Board Members:** Supplementary Board Members that can be called in in the event of
unavailability of Ordinary Board Members. The Supplementary Board Member then temporarily gains full
Board Member status during the meeting. The Congress decides on how many Auxiliary Board Members
to elect for the following operational year. It is recommended however to be between two and three.
**- Auditors:** The Congress should also choose at least one but preferably two Auditors. They shall have
access to oversee all Board operations. At the end of the Operational Year, they shall present a report of
the Boards operations to the Congress. The purpose of these Auditors is to make sure the Board is
acting ethically, lawfully and according to the Bylaws. They may also work in junction with ethics boards.
The responsibility of the Auditors are not to the Board but to the Foundation and are expected to act as
whistleblowers if necessary. Auditors must be impartial and are thus not eligible to act as Board members
and may not inhibit other positions that may put them in a position of bias.

##### §6.4 Terms

Each Elected Official is to serve on a yearly basis from Ordinary Annual Congress to Ordinary Annual
Congress. In the future, a set of the Board Members may serve for two years as a way to provide stability
during Board transitions.

##### §6.5 Nomination and Election

Any Member of legal age may run for Board Membership. The Nomination Committee (see §7.4) should
conduct interviews with potential candidates and may nominate Members they see fit. The Nomination
Committee should present the Candidates before the Congress votes.

The voting process may be conducted through acclimation or closed ballots, at the request of the Congress or
the discretion of the Congress Chairperson. The voting process may be decided by the Congress, but is
usually a simple majority vote in the case of a single candidate for the post, or in the event, with multiple
candidates for each post the Presidium may with the Congress Delegates approval decide on a more
appropriate method.

In cases where not enough candidates are available to cover all posts, the Congress may with a vote empower
the acceding Board to within the Board themselves appoint Board Members to the required posts during the
Constitutional Meeting.

##### §6.6 Constitutional Meeting

Immediately after the closing of the Annual Congress a special Constitutional Meeting should be held. The
Meeting is usually opened by the departing Board Chairperson whom after opening symbolically hands over


the gavel to the acceding Board Chairperson. This marks the Board transition. During the meeting any Board
Officials posts that have not yet been assigned shall be filled as described in §6.5 section III.

Once the Constitutional Meeting is closed the Board and its Elected Officials hold legal power until the next
Annual Congress.

After the Constitutional Meeting it may be custom for the new Board to be sworn in by oath.

##### §6.7 Resignation

For various reasons, members of the Board may choose to resign during the term of office. This person must
then notify the Board of this. It may also be considered reasonable for the person to give an explanation for
this choice. If the Board is still able to reach a quorum as required in the bylaws the board may continue as
usual and may replace the resigning Board Member by swearing in one of the Supplementary Board
Members.

If this is not the case, and a quorum is not possible the board must call for an Extra Annual Congress where
one or more persons are elected as new board members, this is called a by-election.

##### §6.8 Impeachment

In extreme cases of misconduct a Board Member or an Elected Official may be Impeached. An Impeachment
Motion can be initiated by one of the following:

A. The Board

B. The Annual Congress

C. An Ethics Committee

D. Or by request from a majority or significant portion of the Members

These are collectively called “Impeaching Bodies” as they are Bodies who hold the right to Impeach.

Unless the Impeachment Motion is made by the Annual Congress the Motion must then be made available to
the other Impeaching Bodies and has to be ratified by at least one second Impeaching Body. As the Annual
Congress is the highest Governing Body in the Foundation the Motion once approved by the Members
automatically becomes ratified. Parties involved in the case shall abstain from voting in matters they may be at
risk of bias. All concerned parties do however hold the right to state their case before a vote.

Once an Impeachment Motion has been ratified an Impeachment Hearing shall be held as soon as possible.
During this period the individual in question should be relieved from duty and may not participate in votes. The
Impeachment Hearing and must fairly and accurately present the incident or incidents and shall be presided by
a neutral party. Any Ethics Boards shall present their findings to the Hearing. The outcome of the Impeachment
shall be decided by the Foundation’s Members. For practical reasons it may be necessary use a Delegate
voting system similar to the Annual Congress. If the Hearing trough majority vote finds the suspected individual
guilty of misconduct the person becomes Impeached and is immediately removed from Office.


## §7 COMMITTEES

##### §7.1 Abstract

The Foundation may form any number of Committees to aid in the organisation's mission. Committees can be
formed by the Annual Congress or the Foundation Board and answer to the body that formed them. Note that

the Annual Congress has ultimate authority and overwatch over any Committees.

##### §7.2 Management of Committees

The Committees can at their digression appoint their own officials, such as Committee Chairperson and

Committee Secretary. All Committee meetings shall take minutes for the Foundation Book of Records.

##### §7.3 Examples of Committees

It is highly recommended by the Founders that an Ethics Committee be formed. They should answer only to

the Annual Congress and may work in junction with the Foundation Auditors.

Smaller more temporary Committees such as operative Task Forces can also be formed. For example, the
Board may appoint three of its Members to a Task Force designated to plan the logistics concerning the next

Annual Congress.

##### §7.4 Nomination Committee

The Nomination Committee has a central role during the Election Process. The Nomination Committee's main
role is to present and nominate Members to become Board Members and Elected Officials.

The Nomination Committee is appointed by the Annual Congress and operates independent from the Board
and are thus not subject to the authority of the Board but act, just like the Board, on the trust of the
Foundation’s Members and is directly subordinate to the Members.

Before the Vote during the Annual Congress the Nomination Committee shall present their candidates as well
as any top candidates from the community.

##### §7.5 Member Committees

Any Member holds the right to form Committees. The purpose of these Member Committees is to allow any
and all Members to democratically influence the Foundation and make their voices heard. The Founders of

Member Committees should provide notice to the Foundation Secretary after the formation. Member
Committees may be empowered by the Board and/or the Annual Congress to hold special power, an example

of this could be a Member Overwatch or Ethics Committee which could for example be given the power to
hold disciplinary hearings. The empowering Body may issue conditions for the power, such as requiring

elected officials within the Committee.

Member Committees can request funding from the Board and/or the Annual Congress. Note that it should be
required that a Committee Treasurer is appointed for the Committee to hold the right to use Foundation

funding. Upon the end of the Fiscal Year or if the Committee is disbanded a Financial Report shall be made
and become part of the Foundation Final Financial Accounts for review by the Annual Congress.
