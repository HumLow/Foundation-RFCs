RFC STATUS: **WORKING-DRAFT**
Prepared for: The HumLow Foundation
Prepared by: DS on behalf of the Acting Board
Document identifier: RFC-2021-12-21-RD / RFC ID: TBD

## §1 Executive Summary

### §1.1 Abstract
As the HumLow Foundation is to be governed by its Members, the objective of this document is to present a “Rapid Democracy” system for swift and democratically influenced actions through a simple online voting system to collect the opinions and wishes of our Members. The document shall be published as an RFC and is then to be passed on to the appropriate deciding authority to be ratified into Official Policy.

## §2 Rapid Democracy

### §2.1 Abstract
To be able to make swift decisions backed by the wishes of our Members we propose a system of Rapid Democracy. Initially, this can be implemented through RFCs such as this, posted on GitHub to collect feedback.

### §2.2 Evolution
Eventually, we intend for this Rapid Democracy to take place on our website application. See the App RFC. On this website, Members can vote on proposals, RFCs, polls, and more.

For example, the Board can present three product ideas they are ready to take to market, but can only fund two projects. The Board then issues a poll inside the app for the Members to vote on their favourites. The Board should then take the results into advisement and fund the two top projects. This of course is just an example. The RD system is to be a foundation for all executive decisions, thus allowing the Members and possibly also the public to indirectly influence the Foundation and Company.
